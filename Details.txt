Types of Languages in SQL
  DDL ( Data Definition Language ) vs DML ( Data Manipulation Language )

  DDL: Defines the DB
    Queries that allows to create the DB, Table with Data Model
    EG: CREATE TABLE table_name (
          column1 datatype,
          column2 datatype,
          column3 datatype,
          ....
        );
        ALTER - Can only manipulate the definitions
  
  DML: Queries that allows the manipualtion of data in DB rows
    EG:
      Delete, insert, Select, Update

SQL vs NoSql: ( Relational and Non Relational )
  relational data and Queires are also Done in a structured way
NoSQL:
  Non Relational Data
    No Structure for the DB, it allows the storing in few different ways
    JSON, Graph, Key Value Pair

MongoDB:
  NoSql or Non Relational DB

  Advantages of MongoDB:
    1. No Joins Needed, structure is already related together
       in one single table using the composite types
    2. Flexible Schema/Model ( with help of third party library )
       Blueprint of a table or Shape of the Data, 
       Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. **Collections do not 
       enforce document structure by default**. This flexibility 
       gives you data-modeling choices to match your application 
       and its performance requirements.
    3. BSON - Binary JSON, Simple JSON like structure stored as BSON 
              that way optimizes the storage
    4. Embedded Documents:
        JSON/Array inside the Same Object

  MongoDB                         SQL

  Database                    -    Database

  Collection                  -    Table
  Document                    -    Row/Record ( primiitive data type )
    Primitive, Composite( Non 
    Primitive ) Datatypes( 
    array, Object) are also
    allowed
  
  Install and Test the MongoDB

  Server:
        https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community ( Comes along with Compass)
      Shell:
        https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
    If Compass is not available after Server Installation:
      Install Compass:
        https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass

  MongoShell:
    Command Line Tool for Executing the Mongo Query Language  

    Compass:
      UI application for Viewing the DB


Basic Queries in MongoDB:

  _id is used by mongo as primary key to identify each & every document in the database

  Shell Commands:

    show dbs; // list all the databases in the mongodb

    Create DB:
      use <db-name>; // automatically create db reference
    
    insert data:
      insertOne ( Object ), insertMany ( Array ) 

      db.<collection-name>.insertOne/inserMany 
      // automatically creates a collection as well

    Select/Read Operation:
      all:
        db.<collection-name>.find(); // all the records of the collection
      
      filters few records:
        db.<collection-name>.find(<query>, <projections>, <options>);
          query is simple dictionary with key value pair
    
    
Next:
  sorting
  aggregates
